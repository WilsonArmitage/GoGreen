## Storage
The LiteDB setup expects to be able to create a file in C:\Temp\.
Should this not be possible, or you are not on Windows.
The [ProduceDBConnection] will need to be modified accordingly.

## Running in Visual Studio
Use 'Set Startup Projects' to 'Start' the GoGreen and GreenAPI projects.
Then upon pressing 'Start' both projects will run in a browser window. 

The website itself explains the rest of how to use it, where it's not self explanatory.

## Running with 1 line
Execute the file RunAll.ps1 which is in this same Documentation folder. 
Should prompt for NETHost twice, which you'll need to allow, and start the 2 projects.
